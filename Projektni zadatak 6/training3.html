			<h2>Group training
			</h2>
			<p>
				Good company, excellent music, a large number of different programs, an excellent trainer and the pleasant atmosphere of the hall is one of the important reasons why we are visited so much.</p>
			<p>Define your body, get rid of stress, regulate your weight, gain weight and the show can begin. Join the group exercises of our gym.</p>
			<p>We are offering many group programs like pilates, yoga, group cardio sessions and calisthenics</p>
			<p>Group personal training offers valued training at a fraction of the price of an individual trainer. This appeals to members who cannot routinely afford a trainer in a one-on-one setting.
				Specialized training in a group setting creates a social motivation to make lifestyle changes. Those who generally require more guidance can be found in group fitness (larger groups of 50 to 60 people) benefit from specialized training. Additionally, a group training program can attract new prospective training partners who are willing to motivate each other.</p>
