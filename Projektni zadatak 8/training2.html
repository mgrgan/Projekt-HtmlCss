			<h2>Personal training
			</h2>
			<p>A small number of exercisers have knowledge about creating a training plan, the intensity and volume of exercise, the type and correct execution of exercises, the duration of rest, etc. Most of the time, training is reduced to monotonous repetition of the same exercises with a large amount of time spent, which eventually leads to injury and giving up on further exercise. That's why Black Jack Gym recommends individual or personal training, made according to your needs and abilities, with the constant presence of a trainer who takes care of your every move.</p>
			<p>Individual work with our trainer is focused only on you, the risk of injury during training is eliminated, exercise is safer, and progress is much faster with guaranteed results. Based on the obtained test results and the client's goal, an individually adapted training and nutrition program is created. The time spent in training is used in the best possible way, and trainings are scheduled when it suits you and are not time-limited.</p>
			<p>We are able to offer you several types of training that match your training goal such as regulating body weight, increase in muscle size, injury recovery and special preparation for athletes.</p>
